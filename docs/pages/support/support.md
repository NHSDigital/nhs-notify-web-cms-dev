## I'm already using NHS Notify

If you're already using NHS Notify and you need help, you can contact us using our [service portal](https://nhsdigitallive.service-now.com/csm).

This is for NHS England teams that are technically integrated and set up.

### When support is available

We can only respond to your support queries during office hours. Our office hours are 8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays).

NHS Notify is a [silver service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/reference-guide#service-levels). This means it's available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
